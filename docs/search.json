We obtain the estimates, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) by finding the values that minimize the sum of squared residuals, as shown in Equation 1.\n\\[\nSSR = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}[y_i - \\hat{y}_i]^2 = [y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i)]^2 = [y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i]^2\n\\tag{1}\\]\nRecall that we can find the values of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) that minimize /eq-ssr by taking the partial derivatives of Equation 1 and setting them to 0. Thus, the values of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) that minimize the respective partial derivative also minimize the sum of squared residuals.

Thus, \\(\\text{Cov}(x,y) = r s_xs_y\\). Plugging this into Equation 7, we have\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(x,y)}{s_x^2} = r\\frac{s_ys_x}{s_x^2} = r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}\n\\tag{8}\\]"

    "section": "Hat Matrix & Leverage",
    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

When reporting results, however, it is best to give all interpretations in terms of the original response variable \\(y\\), since interpretations using log-transformed variables are often more difficult to truly understand.\nIn order to get back on the original scale, we need to use the exponential function (also known as the anti-log), \\(\\exp\\{x\\} = e^x\\).

From the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of \\(x\\), the distribution of \\(\\log(y)\\) is Normal, and therefore symmetric.

Under this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between \\(\\log(x)\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\), such that \\(\\log(y) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x), \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). In other words, we can model the relationship between \\(\\log(x)\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\) using the model in Equation 5.\n\\[\n\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)\n\\tag{5}\\]\nBecause the response variable is log-transformed, the interpretations on the original scale will be in terms of the median of \\(y\\) (see the section on the log-transformed response variable for more detail).\nIntercept: The intercept is the mean of \\(y\\) when \\(\\log(x) = 0\\), i.e. \\(x = 1\\). Therefore, when \\(\\log(x) = 0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x = 1\\) \\((\\log(x) = 0)\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is interpreted in terms of the change in the median \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), since \\(\\log(Cx) = \\log(x) + \\log(C)\\). Thus, when \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), the change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(Cx)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)]\\} &=\n\\exp\\{\\beta_1 [\\log(Cx) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1[\\log(C) + \\log(x) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1 \\log(C)\\} = C^{\\beta_1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(Cx\\) is \\(C^{\\beta_1}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiple by a factor of \\(C^{\\beta_1}\\). For example, if \\(x\\) is doubled, then the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiply by \\(2^{\\beta_1}\\)."

    "text": "What is regression analysis\n\n\n“In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or predictors). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia"

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.\nThe data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:\n\nnatmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”\nage: Age in years.\nsex: Sex recorded as male or female\nsei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100\nregion: Region where interview took place\npolviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:\n“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7.

    "text": "Exercises\nThe goal of today’s lab is to use the GSS to examine the relationship between US adults’ political views and attitudes towards government spending on mass transportation projects.\n\nPart I: Exploratory data analysis\n\nLet’s begin by making a binary variable for respondents’ views on spending on mass transportation. Create a new variable that is equal to “1” if a respondent said spending on mass transportation is about right and “0” otherwise. Then make a plot of the new variable, using informative labels for each category.\nRecode polviews so it is a factor with levels that are in an order that is consistent with question on the survey. Note how the categories are spelled in the data.\n\nMake a plot of the distribution of polviews.\nWhich political view occurs most frequently in this data set?\n\nMake a plot displaying the relationship between satisfaction with mass transportation spending and political views. Use the plot to describe the relationship the two variables.\nWe’d like to use age as a quantitative variable in your model; however, it is currently a character data type because some observations are coded as \"89 or older\".\n\nRecode age so that is a numeric variable. Note: Before making the variable numeric, you will need to replace the values \"89 or older\" with a single value.\nThen plot the distribution of age.\n\n\n\n\nPart II: Logistic regression model\n\nBriefly explain why we should use a logistic regression model to predict the odds a randomly selected person is satisfied with spending on mass transportation.\nLet’s start by fitting a model using the demographic factors - age, sex, sei10, and region - to predict the odds a person is satisfied with spending on mass transportation. Make any necessary adjustments to the variables so the intercept will have a meaningful interpretation. Neatly display the model.\nInterpret the intercept in the context of the data.\nConsider the relationship between age and one’s opinion about spending on mass transportation. Interpret the coefficient of age in terms of the odds of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation."

Write the answers to Exercises 3 and 4.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWould the members of your group drink a coffee represented by the intercept? Why or why not? Discuss as a group and write the group’s consensus.\n\n\nExercise 4\nLeverage is the measure of the distance between an observation’s values of the predictor variables and the average values of the predictor variables for the entire data set. An observation s set if have high leverage if its combination of values for the predictor variables is very far from the typical combination of values in the data.An observation has high leverage if its combination of values for the predictor variables is very far from the typical combination of values in the data. Observations with high leverage should be considered as potential influential points.\nWe will proceed assuming the model conditions hold, so let’s focus on the model diagnostics. We’ll start by examining if there are any points with high leverage in the data.\nTheoretically, the leverage of the \\(i^{th}\\) observation as follows:\n\\[\nh_i = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nNote that leverage only depends on values of the predictor variable(s).\nThe sum of the leverages for all points is \\(p + 1\\), where\n\n\\(p\\) is the number of predictors\nIn the case of SLR, \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^n h_i = 2\\)\nThe “typical” leverage is \\(\\frac{(p + 1)}{n}\\)\n\nTherefore, an observation is said to have high leverage if\n\\[\nh_i &gt; \\frac{2(p + 1)}{n}\n\\]\nIn addition to comparing the leverage of points to a threshold, we also generally visualize standard residuals vs. leverage values our data. The autoplot() function from the ggfortify package is very useful for drawing these standard plots easily.\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 5)\n\n\nWhat threshold will you use to determine if there are points with high leverage for this dataset?\nAre there any observations with high leverage? If so, how many? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response. Improve your plot by adding a new year to draw a vertical line (with geom_vline()) at the value of the threshold you’re using to determine which points have high leverage.\n\n\nTeam Member 2: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 3, 4: Once Team Member 2 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo. Then, in RStudio, click the Pull button in the Git pane to get the updated document. You should see the responses to Exercises 3 and 4 in your .qmd file.\n\n\nNow it’s time for another hand off…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Team Member 3: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 5.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nAnother standard model diagnostic involves identifying points that don’t fit the pattern from the regression line. We do this by determining which points have large standardized residuals (residual divided by the standard error of residuals).\n\\[\nStd.~res_i = \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_1}{\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon ~ \\sqrt{1 - h_i}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon\\) is the regression standard error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese values are already calculated in the output of augment().\n\n\nObservations that have standardized residuals of large magnitude (usually beyond \\(\\pm\\) 3) are potential outliers, since they don’t fit the pattern determined by the regression model. Therefore, a common practice is to plot standardized residuals vs. fitted values, to make it easier to identify outliers.\nWe can obtain this plot with the following:\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 3)\n\nCreate this visualization and horizontal lines (with geom_hline()) at the cutoff values for “large” standardized residuals (\\(\\pm\\) 3). Are there any such points in the data? If so, how many? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\n\nTeam Member 3: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 2, 4: Once Team Member 3 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo. Then, in RStudio, click the Pull button in the Git pane to get the updated document. You should see the responses to Exercise 5 and 4 in your .qmd file.\n\n\nNow it’s time for another hand off…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Team Member 4: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 6.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nFinally, we’ll examine Cook’s Distance. An observation’s influence on the regression line depends on how close it lies to the general trend of the data (i.e., its standardized residual) and it’s leverage (\\(h_i\\)). Cook’s Distance is a statistic that includes both of these components to measure an observation’s overall impact on the model. Cook’s Distance for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is defined as the follows:\n\\[\nD_i = \\frac{(std.~res)^2}{p + 1} (\\frac{h_i}{1-\\frac{h_i})\n\\]\nAn observation with large \\(D_i\\) is said to have a strong influence on the predicted values. On that scale,\n\n\\(D_i\\) &gt; 0.5 is moderately influential\n\\(D_i\\) &gt; 1 is very influential\n\nWe can plot of Cook’s distances vs. the observation number with the following:\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 4, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\nStandardized residuals, leverage, and Cook’s Distance should all be examined together. So what do we do with observations identified as outliers or leverage points?\nIt is OK to drop an observation based on the predictor variables if…\n\nIt is meaningful to drop the observation given the context of the problem\nYou intended to build a model on a smaller range of the predictor variables. You should mention this in the write up of the results and be careful to avoid extrapolation when making predictions.\n\nIt is not OK to drop an observation based on the response variable if…\n\nThese are legitimate observations and should be in the model.\nYou can try transformations or increasing the sample size by collecting more data.\n\nSo lastly, let’s analyze Cook’s D to determine if there are influential points in the data.\n\nBased on Cook’s D, are there any influential points in our data? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\nIf there are influential points, briefly explain why they are outliers, i.e., not in the trend of the rest of the data.\nIf there are influential points, remove those points from the data and refit the model. How do the model coefficients change, if at all?\nIf there are influential points, would you recommend using the model fit with or without these points for inferential conclusions and predictions? Briefly explain why or why not. Additionally, briefly explain potential impacts your choice has on inferential conclusions and/or predictions.\n\n\nTeam Member 4: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 2, 3: Once Team Member 4 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo.

The main goal is to reinforce our understanding of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce git and GitHub, the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\n\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nTo make versioning simpler, this is a solo lab. In the future, you’ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and producing a single lab report for your lab team, but for now, concentrate on getting the basics down.\n\n\nBy the end of the lab, you will…\n\nBe familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using RMarkdown\nPractice version control using GitHub\nBe able to create data visualizations using ggplot2\nBe able to describe variable distributions and the relationship between multiple variables"

You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, you will need to reserve a container for STA210 first.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your SSH key\nYou will authenticate GitHub using SSH. Below are an outline of the authentication steps; you are encouraged to follow along as your TA demonstrates the steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou only need to do this authentication process one time on a single system.\n\n\n\nType credentials::ssh_setup_github() into your console.\nR will ask “No SSH key found. Generate one now?” You should click 1 for yes.\nYou will generate a key. It will begin with “ssh-rsa….” R will then ask “Would you like to open a browser now?” You should click 1 for yes.\nYou may be asked to provide your GitHub username and password to log into GitHub. After entering this information, you should paste the key in and give it a name. You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used, e.g., sta210).\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions here if you’re interested.\n\n\nConfigure Git\nThere is one more thing we need to do before getting started on the assignment. Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nTo do so, you will use the use_git_config() function from the usethis package.\nType the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"GitHub username\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\n  )\n\nFor example, mine would be\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"mine-cetinkaya-rundel\", \n  user.email = \"cetinkaya.mine@gmail.com\"\n  )\n\nYou are now ready interact with GitHub via RStudio!\n\n\nClone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\nGo to the course organization at github.com/sta210-s22 organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix lab-1. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text Clone with SSH). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\nIn RStudio, go to File ➛ New Project ➛Version Control ➛ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box Repository URL. Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\nClick Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick lab-1-ikea.qmd to open the template R Markdown file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n\n\nR and R Studio\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\nYAML\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOpen the Quarto (`.qmd`) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. click on Push."

    "text": "Exercises\nWrite all code and narrative in your R Markdown file. Write all narrative in complete sentences. Throughout the assignment, you should periodically Render your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, commit the changes in the Git pane, and push the updated files to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure we can read all or your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (%&gt;%) and plus sign (+).\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nThe view() function helped us get a quick view of the dataset, but let’s get more detail about its structure. Viewing a summary of the data is a useful starting point for data analysis, especially if the dataset has a large number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Run the code below to use the glimpse() function to see a summary of the ikea dataset.\nHow many observations are in the ikea dataset? How many variables?\n\nglimpse(ikea)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn your lab-1-ikea.qmd document you’ll see that we already added the code required for the exercise as well as a sentence where you can fill in the blanks to report the answer. Use this format for the remaining exercises.\nAlso note that the code chunk as a label: glimpse-data. It’s not required, but good practice and highly encouraged to label your code chunks in this way.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nWe begin each regression analysis with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help us “get to know” the data and examine the variable distributions and relationships between variables. We do this by visualizing the data and calculating summary statistics to describe the variables in our dataset. In this lab, we will focus on data visualizations.\nLet’s begin by looking at the price of Ikea furniture. Use the code below to visualize the distribution of price_usd, the price in US dollars.\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the visualization to describe the distribution of price. In your narrative, include description of the shape, approximate center, approximate spread, and any presence of outliers. Briefly explain why the median is more representative of the center of this distribution than the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen using the visual editor you can insert a code chunk using the Insert menu on top or by using the catch-all ⌘ / shortcut to insert just about anything. Just execute the shortcut then type what you want to insert. If you are at the beginning of a line you can also enter plain / to invoke the shortcut.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWhen we make visualizations, we want them to be clear and suitable for a professional audience. This means that, at a minimum, each visualization should have an informative title and informative axis labels. Let’s modify the plot from the previous question to make it suitable for a professional audience. Complete the code below to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"_____\",\n    y = \"_____\",\n    title = \"_____\"\n  )\n\n\nThis is a good place to fender, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nAnother way to visualize numeric data is using density plots. Make a density plot to visualize the distribution of price_usd. Be sure to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\nIn this course, we’ll be most interested in the relationship between two or more variables, so let’s begin by looking at the distribution of price by category. We’ll focus on the five categories in the code below, since these include commonly purchased types of furniture.\nUse the code below to create a new data frame that only includes the furniture categories of interest. We’re assigning this data frame to an object with a new name, so we don’t overwrite the original data.\nHow many observations are in the ikea_sub dataset? How many variables?\n\nikea_sub &lt;- ikea %&gt;%\n  filter(category %in% c(\n    \"Tables & desks\", \"Beds\",\n    \"Bookcases & shelving units\",\n    \"Sofas & armchairs\", \"Children's furniture\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will use this newly constructed data frame, ikea_sub, for the remainder of the lab.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nLet’s make a new visualization with the density curves colored by category, so we can compare the distribution of price for each category.\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nThe overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what’s happening with the distributions for the categories plotted first and hence covered by categories plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The alpha argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so it’s best to try a few.\nRecreate the density plot using a more suitable alpha level, so we can more easily see the distribution of all the categories. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 4 and 5”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nBriefly describe why we defined the fill of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot (inside the aes function) but we defined the alpha level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.\n\n\nExercise 7\nOverlapping density plots are not the only way to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable.\nUse a different type of plot to visualize the relationship between price_usd and category. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the ggplot2 cheatsheet and from Data to Viz for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\nCompare and contrast your plots from the previous exercise to the overlapping density plots from Exercise 5. What features are apparent in the plot from the previous exercise that aren’t in the overlapping density plots? What features are apparent in the overlapping density plots that aren’t in the plot from the previous exercise? What features are apparent in both?\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 6 - 8”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nNext, let’s look at the relationship between the price and width of Ikea furniture. Fill in the code below to visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatterplot.\nThen, use your visualization to describe the relationship between the width and price of Ikea furniture.\n\nggplot(data = _____, aes(x = width, y = _____)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"_____\", \n    y = \"_____\", \n    title = \"_____\"\n    )\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nColor the points of the scatterplot by category. Describe how the relationship between price and width of Ikea furniture differs by category, if at all.\n\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! Render, commit, and push all remaining changes. You can use the commit message “Done with Lab 1!” , and make sure you have committed and pushed all changed files to GitHub (your Git pane in RStudio should be empty) and that all documents are updated in your repo on GitHub. The PDF document you submit to Gradescope should be identical to the one in your GitHub repo."

In this experiment, participants were asked to watch a video of a mock crime (from the first person perspective), spend a few minutes completing a random task, and then identify the perpetrator of the mock crime from a line up shown on the screen. Every lineup in this analysis included the true perpetrator from the video. After viewing the line-up , each participant could make one of the following decisions (id):\n\ncorrect: correctly identified the true perpetrator\nfoil: incorrectly identified the “foil”, i.e. a person who looks very similar to the perpetrator\nreject: incorrectly concluded the true perpetrator is not in the lineup\n\nThe main objective of the analysis is to understand how different conditions of the mock crime and suspect lineup affect the decision made by the participant. We will consider the following conditions to describe the decisions:\n\nlineup: How potential suspects are shown to the participants\n\nSimultaneous Lineup: Participants were shown photos of all 6 potential suspects at the same time and were required to make a single decision (identify someone from the lineup or reject the lineup).\nSequential 5 Lineup: Photos of the 6 suspects were shown one at a time. The participant was required to make a decision (choose or don’t choose) as each photo was shown. Once a decision was made, participants were not allowed to reexamine a photo. If the participant made an identification, the remaining photos were not shown.

    "text": "Part 1 - Conceptual\n\nDealing with categorical predictors. Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they’re in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they’re not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\nHigh correlation, good or bad? Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nTraining for the 5K. Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: days_since_start (number of days since starting training), days_till_race (number of days left until the race), mood (poor, good, awesome), tiredness (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and time (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss). Top few rows of the data they collect is shown below.\n\n\n\ndays_since_start\ndays_till_race\nmood\ntiredness\ntime\n\n\n\n\n1\n29\ngood\n3\n25:45\n\n\n2\n28\npoor\n5\n27:13\n\n\n3\n27\nawesome\n4\n24:13\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nUsing these data Nico wants to build a model predicting time from the other variables. Should they include all variables shown above in their model? Why or why not?\nMultiple regression fact checking. Determine which of the following statements are true and false. For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIf predictors are colinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable’s coefficient.\nSuppose a numerical predictor \\(x\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2.5\\) in a multiple regression model. Suppose also that the first observation has \\(x_{1,1} = 7.2\\), the second observation has a value of \\(x_{2,1} = 8.2\\), and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\nIf a regression model’s first predictor has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 5.7\\) and if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its \\(x_1\\) be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value \\(\\hat{y}_1\\) for this observation would increase by 5.7."

The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\nBody mass. Our first goal is to fit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from bill length, bill depth, flipper length, species, and sex.\n\nFit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from the other variables listed above.\nWrite the equation of the regression model.\nInterpret each one of the slopes in this context.\nCalculate the residual for a male Adelie penguin that weighs 3750 grams with the following body measurements: bill_length_mm = 39.1, bill_depth_mm = 18.7, flipper_length_mm = 181. Does the model overpredict or underpredict this penguin’s weight?\nFind the \\(R^2\\) of this model and interpret this value in context of the data and the model.\n\n\n\n\nBill depth. Next we’ll be focusing on bill depth and bill length and also considering species.\n\nFit a model predicting bill depth from bill length. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nThen, add a new predictor: species. Fit another model predicting bill depth from bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nFinally, add one more predictor: the interaction between bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nUsing the three criteria you recorded for these three models, and with the goal of parsimony, which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species. Explain your reasoning.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part a. Hint: Make a scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length and add the linear model.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part b. Hint: Same as part (e), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part c. Hint: Same as part (f), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nBased on your visualizations from parts e - g, and with the goal of parsimony, is your answer for which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species the same as your answer in part d?

For this study titled Influence of perceived threat of Covid-19 and HEXACO personality traits on toilet paper stockpiling, researchers conducted an online survey March 23 - 29, 2020 and used the results to fit multiple linear regression models to draw conclusions about their research questions. From their survey, they collected data on adults across 35 countries. Given the small number of responses from people outside of the United States, Canada, and Europe, only responses from people in these three locations were included in the regression analysis.\nLet’s consider their results for the model looking at the effect on perceived threat of Covid-19. The model can be found on page 6 of the paper. The perceived threat of Covid was quantified using the responses to the following survey question:\n\nHow threatened do you feel by Coronavirus?

RStudio has a drop-down menu that allows you to easily navigate between the code-chunks in your file. The drop-down menu also shows the keyboard shortcuts. Two very useful ones are Ctrl-Alt-C for running the current code-chunk, and Ctrl-Alt-R for running all of them. If you run code-chunks in such a way, their output will go to the regular places, i.e. the console and the Plots-window. So that is different from weaving the file using knitr, which makes the outputs part of your new external HTML-, pdf- or Word-document. So using these Ctrl-Alt commands is good for testing your code before weaving.\n\nR-code 1\nLet’s have some text first. OK, now the code:\nset.seed(1)\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\nmean(x)\n[1] 0.1088874\n\n\nR-code 2\nThis time we use the same R-code but following option: results=“hide”:\n\nset.seed(1)\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\nmean(x)\n\nThat second bit of code was evaluated, but no results were shown in the final document.\n\n\nR-code 3: inline\nR-code does not have to be placed in code-chunks beginning and ending in ```. Code can also be used inline, as part of a regular text-sentence. In this example we do first use a code-chunk, but just to calculate the variables ‘time’ and ‘rand’. Thereafter the values of those variables can be included inline.\ntime &lt;- format(Sys.time(), \"%a %b %d %X %Y\")\nrand &lt;- rnorm(1)\nThe time is now Mon Nov 20 16:03:35 2023, and our random number of the day is: -0.6203667. Another example of an inline calculation is this: pi^2 is equal to 9.8696044.\n\n\nR-code 4: Creating plots\nLet’s first get some numbers to plot:\nx &lt;- rnorm(50); y &lt;- x + rnorm(50,sd=0.3)\nNow we create a scatterplot of those numbers:\npar(mar=c(5,4,1,1),las=1)\nplot(x,y,main=\"Some random numbers\")\n\nNote: if we export to an HTML-file, that plot will embedded!

    "text": "Why is MCMC so useful for Bayesian modelling?\nBayes’ Theorem tells us how to use data D to change a prior into a posterior: p(x|D) = p(x) p(D|x) / p(D). There is usually no problem specifying a prior p(x) and a likelihood function L(x) = p(D|x). But we usually do not know what p(D) is. So we cannot write down the formula for the posterior. But we can still use MCMC because the troublesome p(D) terms cancel out in the ratio p(xa|D) / p(xb|D) for any pair of points xa and xb in parameter space. The ratio of posterior probabilities for xa and xb is thus the ratio of “prior times likelihood” for xa and xb:\np(xa|D) / p(xb|D) = p(xa) p(D|xa) / (p(xb) p(D|xb)).\nBecause that posterior ratio is usually known for any pair of points, MCMC can be used to sample from posterior distributions."

However, you will be able to transfer the methods and techniques to any other model, data set or research question. There will be time during practical exercises where you can opt to use the materials provided by the trainers, or use your own model(s) and data.\n\n\nLearning objectives:\nBy the end of the course, learners will be able to:\n\nUnderstand scientific papers that use Bayesian methods and terminology\nKnow how to use Bayesian software\nDesign and apply simple Bayesian statistical models\nKnow how to combine disparate data sets in a single analysis\nCompare the relative plausibility of different models\nComprehensively analyse uncertainties associated with model outputs\nCommunicate uncertainties clearly\n\n\n\nTarget audience:\n\nPhD students\nEarly career researchers\nAcademics/ researchers, including those from industry or the charitable sector\n\n\n\nLevel:\nIntermediate\nLearners need to have some practical knowledge of the programming language R. No previous exposure to probability theory or Bayesian methods is necessary, but students may want to read some introductory material beforehand. We recommend the reading listed below:"

    "section": "Exercises",
    "text": "Exercises\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in-person voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is “Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?”\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Counties in North Carolina\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus on counties in North Carolina. We will use the data sets election_nc and county_map_data.\n\nVisualize the distribution of the response variable inperson_pct and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\nLet’s view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of North Carolina with the color of each county filled in based on the percentage of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election. Fill in title and axis labels.\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\nWhat are 2 - 3 observations you have from the plot?\nWhat is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn’t apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise? What is a feature that is apparent in the histogram that is not apparent in the map?\n\n\n\nelection_map_data &lt;- left_join(election_nc, county_map_data)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = county_map_data,\n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n    fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"white\"\n    ) +\n  geom_polygon(data = election_map_data, \n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n    fill = inperson_pct)\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"___\",\n    y = \"___\",\n    fill = \"___\",\n    title = \"___\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  coord_quickmap()\n\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between inperson_pct and pctTrump_2016. Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, now is a good time to render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe can use a linear regression model to better quantify the relationship between the variables.\n\nFit the linear model to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nWrite the regression equation using mathematical notation.\n\nNow let’s use the model coefficients to describe the relationship.\n\nInterpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\nDoes it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\nIf the linear model is a good fit to these data, there should be no structure left in the residuals and the residuals should have constant variance. Augment the data with the model to obtain the residuals and predicted values for each observation, and call the augmented data frame nc_election_aug (You will use this name in Exercise 8). Then, make a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values, and based on this plot, and provide a brief explanation for whether these two conditions are met. Hint: Zoom out on the plot by extending the limits of the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven’t done so recently and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe might also be interested in our observations being independent, particularly if we are to use these data for inference. To evaluate whether the independence condition is met, we will examine a map of the counties in North Carolina with the color filled based on the value of the residuals.\n\nBriefly explain why we may want to view the residuals on a map to assess independence.\nBriefly explain what pattern (if any) we would expect to observe on the map if the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nFill in the name of your model in the code below to calculate the residuals and add them to election_map_data. Then, a map with the color of each county filled in based on the value of the residual. Hint: Start with the code from Exercise 2.\nIs the independence condition satisfied? Briefly explain based on what you observe from the plot.\n\nnc_election_aug &lt;- nc_election_aug %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(fips = election_nc$fips)\n\nelection_map_data &lt;- left_join(election_map_data, nc_election_aug)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next part, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Inference for the U.S.\nTo get a better understanding of the trend across the entire United States, we analyze data from a random sample of 200 counties. This data is in the election_sample data frame. Because these counties were randomly selected out of the 3,006 counties in the United States, we can reasonably treat the counties as independent observations.\n\nFit the linear model to these sample data to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope using a permutation test. In your response, state the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and state the conclusion in the context of the data.\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\nComment on whether the hypothesis test and confidence interval support the general consensus that Republican voters were more likely to vote in-person in the 2020 election? A brief explanation is sufficient but it should be based on your conclusions from Exercises 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates."

    "text": "Part 2 - GDP and Urban population\nData on countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and percentage of urban population was collected and made available by The World Bank in 2020. A description of the variables as defined by The World Bank are provided below.\n\nGDP: “GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.”\nUrban Population (% of total): “Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.”\n\nThe data can be found in the data folder of your repository. Read the data and name it gdp_2020.\n\nFit a model predicting GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the linear model seem appropriate for modeling this relationship? Explain your reasoning.\nAdd a new column to the gdp_2020 dataset called gdp_log which is the (natural) log of gdp.\nFit a new model, predicting the log of GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the model predicting logged GDP or original GDP appear to be a better fit? Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe model output for predicting logged GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n6.107\n0.202\n30.291\n0\n\n\nurban\n0.042\n0.003\n13.769\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear model for predicting log of GDP can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\log(GDP)} = 6.11 + 0.042 \\times urban\n\\]\nTherefore, the coefficient of urban (0.042) can be interpreted as the change in logged GDP associated with 1 percentage point increase in urban population. The problem is, logged GDP is not a very informative value to talk about. So we need to undo the transformation we’ve done.\nTo do so, let’s do a quick review of some properties of logs.\n\nSubtraction and logs: \\(log(a) − log(b) = log(\\frac{a}{b})\\)\nNatural logarithm: \\(e^{log(x)} = x\\)\n\nBased on the interpretation of the slope above, the difference between the predicted values of logged GDP for a given value of urban and a value that is 1 percentage point higher is 0.0425. Let’s write this out mathematically, and then use the properties we’ve listed above to work through the equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog(\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1) - log(\\text{GDP for urban } x) &= 0.042 \\\\\nlog\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big) &= 0.042 \\\\\ne^{log\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big)} &= e^{0.042}\\\\\n\\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} &= e^{0.042}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nBased on the derivation above, fill in the blanks in the following sentence for an alternative (and more useful interpretation) of the slope of urban.\n\nFor each additional percentage point the urban population is higher, the GDP of a country is expected to be ___, on average, by a factor of ___."

We can conduct a hypothesis test via simulation (what we’ll do in this lab) or using mathematical models (what we’ll do in the next class).\nBefore we can conduct the hypothesis test, let’s first set our hypotheses. Remember that the null hypothesis represents the status quo (nothing going on, i.e. there is no relationship) and the alternative hypothesis represents our research question (there is something going on, i.e. there is a relationship).\n\n\\(H_0\\): There is no linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(H_A\\): There is a linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will use a permutation test, where we\n\nSimulate new samples from the original sample via permutation under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true\nFit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope\nUse features of the distribution of the permuted slopes to calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test\n\nThe major difference between constructing a confidence interval and conducting a hypothesis test is that for the hypothesis test we assume that the null hypothesis is true. This requires a simulation scheme that will allow us to measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but not due to cost and admission rate being correlated by permuting permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables. To do so, we randomly assign each admrate value to cost of a given university, i.e. cost and admrate are no longer matched for a given university.\nIn the following code chunk we\n\nFirst set a seed for simulating reproducibly.\nThen, we start with our data frame and specify our model as cost vs. admrate.\nThen, we set our null hypothesis (cost and admrate are independent)\nAnd then we generate 1000 replicates of our data where, for each replicate, we permute values of admrate to randomly assign them to values of cost\nFinally, we fit our model to each of our 1000 permuted datasets\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nperm_fits &lt;- scorecard %&gt;%\n  specify(cost ~ admrate) %&gt;%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %&gt;%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %&gt;%\n  fit()\n\nThe resulting dataset perm_fits has nrow(perm_fits) and ncol(perm_fits) columns. The first column, replicate indicates the replicate number of the dataset the models were fit to; the values in this column range between 1 and 1000. The second column, term, tells us which term (intercept of the model or slope of admrate) the estimate value in the third column is for.\n\nperm_fits\n\n# A tibble: 2,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1,000]\n   replicate term      estimate\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1         1 intercept  36857. \n 2         1 admrate     -781. \n 3         2 intercept  35901. \n 4         2 admrate      643. \n 5         3 intercept  36608. \n 6         3 admrate     -411. \n 7         4 intercept  35831. \n 8         4 admrate      746. \n 9         5 intercept  36367. \n10         5 admrate      -51.7\n# … with 1,990 more rows\n\n\n\nCreate a histogram of the slope estimates in perm_fits. (Hint: Filter the dataset for just the slope values, term == \"admrate\".)\nEstimate the p-value of the hypothesis test based on this distribution.\nState your conclusion for the test in context.\nIndicate whether or not it is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test from the previous exercise. Briefly explain your response.\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.

And there’s a good reason why we’re doing it all at once; we’re going to drastically change our data frame, from one row per line spoken to one row per episode. We’ll call the resulting data frame office_episodes.\nThe two tasks are as follows:\n\nTask 1. Identify episodes where the word “halloween”, “valentine”, or “christmas” were ever mentioned, using variables you created above.\nTask 2. Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of The Office.\n\nBelow are some instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\nStart by grouping theoffice data by season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, and air_date. (These variables, except for season have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\nUse summarize() to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\nTask 1:\n\nCalculate the number of lines per season per episode, you might name this new variable n_lines.\nThen, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four characters Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, and lines_dwight, respectively.\n\nTask 2:\n\nCreate a variable called halloween that sums up the 1s in halloween_mention at the season-episode level and takes on the value \"yes\" if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or \"no\" otherwise.\nDo something similar for new variables valentine and christmas as well based on values from valentine_mention and christmas_mention.\n\nFinish up your summarize() statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped and remove n_lines (we won’t use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n\noffice_episodes &lt;- theoffice %&gt;%\n  group_by(___) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) &gt;= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-n_lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy summarize() and not mutate()? We use mutate() to add / modify a column of a data frame. The output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame. On the other hand, we use summarize() to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\nAnd what about that .groups argument in summarize? Try running your summarize() step without it first. You’ll see that R print out a message saying “summarize() has grouped output by season, episode. You can override using the .groups argument.” summarize() will only drop the last group. So if you want a data frame that doesn’t have a grouping structure as a result of a summaerize(), you can explicitly ask for that with .groups = \"drop\".

Add an indicator variable, michael, that takes on the value \"yes\" if Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) was in the show, and \"no\" if not.\n\noffice_episodes &lt;- office_episodes %&gt;%\n  mutate(michael = if_else(season &gt; ___, \"___\", \"___\"))\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nPrint out the dimensions (dim()) of the new dataset you created as well as the names() of the columns in the dataset.\nYour new dataset, office_episodes, should have 186 rows and 14 columns. The column names should be season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, air_date, lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, lines_dwight, halloween, valentine, christmas, and michael. If you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong.

You can read more about the survey design and respondents in the README of the GitHub repo for the data.\nRespondents were asked a variety of questions about their political beliefs, thoughts on multiple issues, and voting behavior. We will focus on using the demographic variables and someone’s party identification to understand whether a person is a probable voter.\nThe variables we’ll focus on are (definitions from the codebook in data set GitHub repo):\n\nppage: Age of respondent\neduc: Highest educational attainment category.\nrace: Race of respondent, census categories. Note: all categories except Hispanic are non-Hispanic.\ngender: Gender of respondent\nincome_cat: Household income category of respondent\nQ30: Response to the question “Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a…”\n\n1: Republican\n2: Democrat\n3: Independent\n4: Another party, please specify\n5: No preference\n-1: No response\n\nvoter_category: past voting behavior:\n\nalways: respondent voted in all or all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\nsporadic: respondent voted in at least two, but fewer than all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\nrarely/never: respondent voted in 0 or 1 of the elections they were eligible in\n\n\nYou can read in the data directly from the GitHub repo:\n\nvoters &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/non-voters/nonvoters_data.csv\")\n\nNote that the authors use weighting to make the final sample more representative on the US population for their article. We will not use weighting in this assignment, so we should treat the sample as a convenience sample rather than a random sample of the population."

    "text": "Exercises\n\nWhy do you think the authors chose to only include data from people who were eligible to vote for at least four election cycles?\nLet’s prepare the data for analysis and modeling.\n\nThe variable Q30 contains the respondent’s political party identification. Make a new variable that simplifies Q30 into four categories: “Democrat”, “Republican”, “Independent”, “Other” (“Other” also includes respondents who did not answer the question).\nThe variable voter_category identifies the respondent’s past voter behavior. Relevel the variable to make rarely/never the baseline level, followed by sporadic, then always.\n\nIn the FiveThirtyEight article, the authors include visualizations of the relationship between the voter category and demographic variables such as race, age, education, etc. Select two demographic variables. For each variable, interpret the plot to describe its relationship with voter category.\nFit a model using mean-centered age, race, gender, income, and education to predict voter category. Show the code used to fit the model, but do not display the model output.\n\nNext, we want to determine whether party identification be added to the model. In order to do this we need to compare two nested models.\n\nThe reduced model is the one we fit so far, including the predictors mean-centered age, race, gender, income, and education.\nThe full model is the one that includes, in addition to these predictors, party identification.\n\n\nShould party identification be added to the model? Use a drop-in-deviance test to determine if party identification should be added to the model. Include the hypotheses in mathematical notation, the output from the test, and the conclusion in the context of the data. Then, neatly display the model you selected.\n\nUse the model you select for the remainder of the assignment.\n\nInterpret the following coefficients in the context of the data in terms of the odds of voting sporadically versus rarely/never.\n\nInterpret the intercept in the context of the data. Use actual values in the interpretation.\nInterpret the effect of age in the context of the data.\nInterpret the effect of party ID in the context of the data. Include discussion about which level(s) differ from the baseline.\n\nIn the article, the authors write\n\n“Nonvoters were more likely to have lower incomes; to be young; to have lower levels of education; and to say they don’t belong to either political party, which are all traits that square with what we know about people less likely to engage with the political system.”\n\nDoes your model support this statement? Briefly explain why or why not.\nLet’s use the model to predict the voting categories. Obtain the predicted voter category for each observation.\n\nCreate a table of the actual versus predicted voter categories and a visualization of the association between the two.\nHow well did the model perform? Briefly assess the model performance using 2 - 3 observations from the table and/or visualization to support your response."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg %&gt;%\n  count(manufacturer) %&gt;%\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), x = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) be \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix of responses, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the \\(n \\times (p+1)\\) matrix of predictors, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\((p+1) \\times 1\\) matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). When \\(n\\) is much larger than the number of predictors \\(p\\), then the differences in these two estimates are trivial."
